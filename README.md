linkedin_industries
===================

A list of LinkedIn industries, in various formats.

The LinkedIn API does not appear to provide an endpoint for retrieving a complete list of industries. If you want a list for your app, you'll need to keep a list handy in your local codebase. And thus.

`linkedin_industries.csv` is pulled from [LinkedIn's official list](http://developer.linkedin.com/documents/industry-codes) and then exported to JSON, YAML, and Ruby source.

The most recent version of this list is [available on Github](https://github.com/jeffomatic/linkedin_industries).
